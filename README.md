# 100-Days-Of-ML-Code
This repository contains my progress for the challenge 100DaysOfMLCode given by Siraj Raval. 100 Days of ML Code is a committment to better your understanding of this powerful tool by dedicating at least 1 hour of your time everyday to studying and/or coding machine learning for 100 days.

## Day 0 : July 6, 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge. I completed the first part of Introduction to Data Science in Python on Coursera to learn python fundamentals and use advanced Python features, including lambdas, list comprehensions and the numpy library.

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exciting. The course is really good and it contain lots of good contents. It is good for a beginner.

## Day 1 : July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Finished the first part of the Machine Learning course on coursera by Andrew Ng up to Linear Regression with One Variable.

**Thoughts** : I learned the application of Linear Regression with one variable to housing price prediction, the notion of a cost function, and the gradient descent method for learning.

## Day 2 : July 8, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Since Linear Algebra is necessary on learning Machine Learning, I review on basic linear algebra concepts. I finished the Linear Algebra Review on machine learning course on Coursera. 

**Thoughts** : I learned about matrices and vectors, addition and scalar multiplication, matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplication, matrix multiplication properties, matrix inverse and matrix transpose operation.

## Day 3 : July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learned linear regression using gradient descent and its equations.

**Thoughts** : The concepts are really good. The Math is explained in a practical way.

## Day 4 : July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learned about Linear Regression with multiple variables, Polynomial Regression, Feature Scaling, and Normal Equation. I  also learned using Octave and did some basic operations, plotting data, control statements, vectorization and finished the first programming assignment.

**Thoughts** : Some concepts are quite difficult at first but I'm able to understand it. I learned how linear regression can be extended to accommodate multiple input features and best practices for implementing linear regression.

## Day 5 : July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learned about Logistic Regression for classification. I also learned about the notion of classification, the cost function for logistic regression, and the application of logistic regression to multi-class classification.

**Thoughts** : There's a lot of new concepts I learned in this topic. One of it is solving the problem of overfitting using regularization.

## Day 6 : July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Watched the Logistic Regression video on youtube by Siraj. I learned about logistic regression using Newton's method for optimization.

**Thoughts** : There's a lot of new terms that I encountered so I need to review them. One of the things I learned is Newton's method usually converges faster than gradient descent when maximizing logistic regression log likelihood.

## Day 7 : July 13, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Finished the programming assignment for Logistic Regression in the Machine Learning Course on Coursera.

**Thoughts** : The assignment is challenging and difficult for me because I need to write the solution using Octave. The programming exercise tutorials and discussion forums of the course helped me in order to finish it.

## Day 8 : July 14, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learned about how neural networks works and how it learns using backpropagation. 

**Thoughts** : Artificial Neural Networks are pretty amazing.

## Day 9 : July 15, 2018

**Today's Progress** : I decided to go through Andrew Trask's A Neural Network in 11 lines of Python to really learn how every line worked, and it's been very helpful. 

**Thoughts** : I had to review some matrix math and look up some numpy function calls that he uses, but it was worth it.

## Day 10 : July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Watched a video from Siraj Raval on how to make a neural network in python from scratch.

**Thoughts** : Learned more about neural networks and see how it is implemented in python code.

## Day 12 : July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learned more about using pandas, which is a Python library for data cleaning and processing. I also learned how to read in data into DataFrame structures, how to query these structures, and the details about such structures are indexed. 

**Thoughts** : Pandas is a very powerful library. It allows you to perform complicated operations efficiently with a small amount of code.
