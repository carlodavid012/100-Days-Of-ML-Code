# 100-Days-Of-ML-Code
This repository contains my progress and codes for the challenge 100DaysOfMLCode given by Siraj Raval.

## Day 0 : July 6, 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge. I also completed the first part of Introduction to Data Science in Python on Coursera to learn python fundamentals and use advanced Python features, including lambdas, list comprehensions and the numpy library.

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exciting. The course is really good and it contain lots of good contents . It is good for a beginner .
