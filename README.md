# 100-Days-Of-ML-Code
This repository contains my progress for the challenge 100DaysOfMLCode given by Siraj Raval. 100 Days of ML Code is a committment to better your understanding of this powerful tool by dedicating at least 1 hour of your time everyday to studying and/or coding machine learning for 100 days.

## Day 0 : July 6, 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge. I completed the first part of Introduction to Data Science in Python on Coursera to learn python fundamentals and use advanced Python features, including lambdas, list comprehensions and the numpy library.

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exciting. The course is really good and it contain lots of good contents. It is good for a beginner.

## Day 1 : July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Finished the first part of the Machine Learning course on coursera by Andrew Ng up to Linear Regression with One Variable.

**Thoughts** : I learned the application of Linear Regression with one variable to housing price prediction, the notion of a cost function, and the gradient descent method for learning.

## Day 2 : July 8, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Since Linear Algebra is necessary on learning Machine Learning, I review on basic linear algebra concepts. I finished the Linear Algebra Review on machine learning course on Coursera. 

**Thoughts** : I learned about matrices and vectors, addition and scalar multiplication, matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplication, matrix multiplication properties, matrix inverse and matrix transpose operation.

## Day 3 : July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learned linear regression using gradient descent and its equations.

**Thoughts** : The concepts are really good. The Math is explained in a practical way.

## Day 4 : July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learned about Linear Regression with multiple variables. I also learned about Polynomial Regression, Feature Scaling, Normal Equation and best practices in implementing linear regression. I also learned how to use Octave and did some basic operations, plotting data, control statements and vectorization.

**Thoughts** : Some concepts are quite difficult but I'm able to get it.
